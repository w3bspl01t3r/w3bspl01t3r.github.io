            <i>Hey there!
            <p>Welcome to my blog post.</p>
            <p>Here I write about the security issues related to java applications, starting from enterprise level application to libraries.</p>
            <p>I also spend time doing 1 Day analysis or you can say patch analysis or Patch diffing for different web apps and libraries specific to Java, but sometimes non java apps as well</p>
            <p>I work as full time security engineer and spend my time learning new tricks and attack techniques</p>
            <p>Feel free to reachout for any feed backs on the blogs</p>

            <h3>Cheers!!</h3>
